<!-- Problem Solution -->
      <section>
        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>
          Current cloud storage providers do not offer the ability to save, share, and organize the content you discover online.
          Revisiting an item that you shared or has been shared with you can require endless scrolling through a thread or relying on your memory of where it came from.
        </p>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>
          Cache is an iOS mobile application that provides a one-stop-shop to store and retrieve the content shared between you and small groups of family and friends.
          Send articles or funny videos straight from the mobile web browser and Cache will automatically store and organize the content for you.

          <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
          <p>
            I prepared a SWOT Analysis of three competitors.
            Dropbox and Google Drive are two of the biggest names in cloud storage service and Pinterest catalogues and collects items found on the web.
          </p>
          <p>
            I saw an opportunity for a new type of product: an application that organizes content by tags or labels as opposed to folders.
            Removing the folder system that drives competitor’s applications allows users to retrieve content with greater ease.
            Tags will automatically be created from the metadata of the file, such as title, location, author, website, and date.
          </p>

        <article>
          <h4>Surveys and Interviews</h4>
          <p>
            I needed to figure out if people would even use an application like Cache.
            The survey results showed that 50% of survey takers are sharing discovered content with close friends and family at least once a week.
            They’re  also sharing photos taken with their smartphone. Survey results and interviews also revealed a desire for easy organization and revisiting.

          <h4>Personas</h4>
            <p>
              I created two personas, one centered on photos and the other on articles.
              Their main focus is the content itself, which needs to be easily stored and retrieved.

            I developed user stories for new, returning, and all users. I took all of the high level stories and a few medium levels to round out a Minimum Viable Product.

          <h4>Wireframes</h4>
          <p>
            I sketched out basic screen layouts, then cleaned them up in Figma, and created a low fidelity clickable prototype in InVision for testing.
            There were a few things to learn from this first round of testing such as the lack of a navigation bar and that the words “tag” and “share” made users think of social media, which meant the concept was not clear.
            I also learned to use Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines more, not just in the visual design but the function as well.
            It also showed me that I needed to offer an opportunity for users to experience the application before signing up, so I created an introduction that used screen grabs of the mockups to show users what to expect.

        <h3>Branding</h3>
        <p>
          This is a utility application where I wanted to provide a non-distracting environment for users to find what they are looking for.
          My goal was to create something clean and simple. While the brand has its own typography, I used Apple’s SF Pro Text for the application itself.

        <h3>High Fidelity Prototype</h3>
        <article>
          <p>
            I took the wireframes and content I created for the marketing website and added visual design.
            I also took the feedback from testing the low fidelity prototype to update the screens and added visual design elements.
            I then created a clickable prototype with these high fidelity mockups to test again, which led to additional updates.

          <h4>Testing Results</h4>
          <p>
            When testing the high fidelity mockups, testers only quickly glanced at the introduction and still didn’t fully understand the concept of the application.
            I updated the “email” references to remove existing associations in an attempt to clarify the concept.
            I also didn’t have an empty state for the application and testers were confused when they signed up for an account then entered into a returning user’s experience.

        <article>
          <h4>Key Learnings</h4>
          <p>
            The first key lesson was the importance of telling your brand story.
            Give the users something to connect with, otherwise you can’t expect them to give you their time and personal information.
            <br>
            The second was the value in testing user stories.
            I was overly concerned that users could complete a task that I didn’t test if the feature was necessary at all.
            In the last iteration, I ended up removing two features.
            <br>
            The third was how to be mindful of using familiar terms and screens.
            My use of “tags,” “email,” and “share” confused testers because they were not being used in the same exact way in this application as in others.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h4>Next Steps</h4>
          <p>
            In the end, users had a harder time understanding the concept of the application than I expected, but I was relieved that they were still able to navigate through the application and complete most tasks without problems.
            Since there were still big changes made to the design, I would like to have tested one more time to validate the updates before moving forward, as well as test the marketing site.
