          <p>
            I've always been interested in art and design and wanted to make it my career, but my dream job kept changing.
            My first dream job was an artist.
            I was going to conquer the world with my paintbrush.
            At the end of high school I was on the path to becoming an Interior Designer.
            When I took a class in the history of design as a college freshman, I was in love with design.
            Yet I didn't see myself as a designer.
            Instead I wanted to be a museum curator who spread the knowledge that these great art and design masters left behind.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I later realized working in museums was not my true calling, I picked up odd jobs to support my New York City life.
            That's when I taught myself web development and started working in restaurants.
            I worked my way up from a Hostess to a Branding Manager of an international restaurant group.
          </p>
          <p>
            I spent many years in the dining room interacting with a variety of guests ranging from CEOs entertaining their Board Members to mall goers grabbing a slice in a food court.
            I enjoyed working with the customers and solving their problems, but I found myself drawn back into the world of design.
          </p>
          <p>
            After a couple of years in branding and marketing, I realized I could combine my strengths of design and problem solving in the field of UX Design.
            I embarked on a new relationship with an old love.
          </p>
          <p class="nospace">
            I'm excited to be at the intersection of design and technology.
            I can't wait to combine an analytical mindset with an artist's eye to craft innovative solutions, tackle new problems and delight users.
